## General information
This Lite-Brite application is a play on the 'Lite-Brite' toy, which consists of a light box with small coloured plastic pegs that fit into a panel and illuminate to create a lit picture.

This application recreates the real-life toy by allowing the user to drag and drop colourful circles to create any image possible within the 50x50 board. They are also able to click a button to randomly fill the board with colours to create a unique image.

Each image created can be saved as an CSV file that can later be uploaded back onto the board so your hard work isn't gone forever!
